I picked Edward Snowden's case, and analyzed the ethical quandries in the case. The first system I chose is national security. Since the government surveillance was an attempt to improve national security, it was important to take a look at this, and it was involved in a lot of ethical problems, and I also considered the NSA spy technology as well. Surveillance technology in general should also be considered, as the NSA is definitely not the last one to do something like this. This case also affected technology lawmaking, and what laws should consider to be ethical. Systems such as hidden cameras, wiretapping, and internet surveillance are also important to look at, as they are a couple of ways an organization can secretly observe others and break their privacy.
There were several ethical quandries to consider, and the first one I chose is secretly spying. Although I personally do not think this is ethical, the main purpose for this was to improve the nation's security. The same can be said of the surveillance of law-abiding citizens, however, this seems to be violate the 'innocent until proven guilty' principle if even uncompromised individuals are spied on as criminals. Leaking data publicly is the crux of the ethical quandry of this case, and whether Snowden should be charged, but also the ethics of leaking sensitive data publicly in general should be considered. How the spying information is used is important as well, and in this case it was mainly supposed to be used for national security purposes.
